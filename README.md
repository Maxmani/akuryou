# Akuryou

A general-purpose Discord bot that I took up as a side project.  
Has whatever commands I feel like adding. It is still very much a work in progress.

## Commands

### Fun

*It's awfully empty here...*

### Music

`/join` - Join a voice channel.  
`/leave` - Leave a voice channel.  
`/play` - Play a music track.  

### Utility

`/convert` - Convert image files to other formats.  
`/webp` - Same as `/convert` but only supports WebP files as input.  

### Misc

`/ping` - Check response time.  
`/source` - Get a link to this page.  
`/stats` - Display some bot statistics.  

## Self-Hosting

To run your own instance, rename [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and add your bot's token to it.
